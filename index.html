        <p>I am a Master’s student in Business Analytics at the University of Texas at Austin in the Department of Information, Risk, and Operations Management (IROM), graduating in Spring 2026. My focus is on data-driven decision making, machine learning, and optimization for complex, real-world problems.</p>
        <p>I previously spent three years at Sprinklr as a Forward Deployed Software Engineer, where I worked on the Reporting & Analytics product suites, tackling large-scale data engineering challenges and building performant, customer-facing analytics features. I also led Sprinklr’s Pan Asian Network employee resource group, organizing well-being initiatives, cultural events, and growing membership across global offices.</p>
        <p>Before Sprinklr, I worked at Zifo Healthcare Analytics, delivering data solutions for life-sciences clients, and at Investocracy as an Equity Research Intern performing market analysis and valuation for early-stage startups. During my undergraduate years at NIT Calicut, I also conducted materials research in Dr. Baiju G. Nair’s lab within the Materials Science & Engineering group.</p>
        <p>I’m excited to explore opportunities starting Summer 2026 that blend data science, forward-deployed engineering, and ML/AI engineering. Longer term, I’m interested in pursuing research in decision sciences, focusing on statistical modeling and optimization for better decision-making under uncertainty.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I spend my time quizzing, playing electric guitar, and experimenting with sound-based AI projects using tools like Runway ML.</p>
