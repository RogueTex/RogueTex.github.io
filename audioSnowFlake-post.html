            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Audio Snowflake project is a dynamic audio visualization tool that transforms sound frequencies into beautiful snowflake-like patterns. The goal of this project was to explore how audio data could be represented visually in a unique and creative way. By utilizing JavaScript and Web Audio APIs, the project captures real-time audio input and converts the frequency data into symmetrical snowflake structures that evolve based on the sound.

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Core functionality and interaction with the Web Audio API.</li>
                <li><strong>HTML5 Canvas:</strong> Drawing the snowflake patterns based on audio frequencies.</li>
                <li><strong>Web Audio API:</strong> Capturing real-time audio data and analyzing its frequency spectrum.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>
                1. **Audio Input Capture:** Using the Web Audio API, the project captures sound either from a file or real-time input (such as a microphone).
            </p>
            <p>
                2. **Frequency Analysis:** The audio is processed through an AnalyserNode to break down the audio into its frequency components. This data is then visualized in real-time, with changes in pitch and volume affecting the shape and size of the snowflakes.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. **Snowflake Rendering:** HTML5 Canvas is used to draw symmetrical patterns, resembling snowflakes. Each spike or branch of the snowflake correlates to a frequency band, and the animation dynamically evolves based on the sound.

            <h2>Outcomes and Results</h2>
            <p>
                The project successfully produced an engaging, real-time visualization of audio data. The snowflake patterns were able to dynamically shift and respond to audio input, with louder and higher-pitched sounds producing larger, more complex snowflakes. The outcome exceeded initial expectations, offering an intuitive and visually appealing representation of sound.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users are able to experiment with different audio inputs and watch as the snowflakes evolve in real-time, offering both a technical challenge and an artistic experience. The project serves as a proof-of-concept for how audio data can be creatively visualized using modern web technologies.
